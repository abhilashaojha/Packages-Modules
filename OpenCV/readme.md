Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos and other visual inputs â€” and take actions or make recommendations based on that information. 

* If AI enables computers to think, computer vision enables them to see, observe and understand.
* Computer vision trains machines to perform simple functions,such as differentiating between objects, but it has to do it in much less time with cameras, data and algorithms rather than retinas, optic nerves and a visual cortex.
* Computer-Vision is playing a major role in self-driving cars, robotics as well as in photo correction apps.
